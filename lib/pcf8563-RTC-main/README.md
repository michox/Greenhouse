# pcf8563-RTC

The `pcf8563-RTC` library is designed to interface ESP chips with the NXP PCF8563 Real-Time Clock (RTC) within the Arduino (C++) Framework.

## Features

- Supports multiple I2C buses: `rtc.begin(Wire1);`
- Timezone support (RTC is set to UTC)
  - [List of timezones](https://github.com/nayarsystems/posix_tz_db/blob/master/zones.csv)
- Sets the system (ESP32) time from the RTC (assumes RTC is set to UTC/GMT)
- Sets the RTC time from the system (epoch)
- Example of setting RTC time using WiFi

## Warnings

- Not all functions are implemented
- Not compatible with Lewis' library
- Only tested with the ESP32 and S2 variants

## Example ESP32 Code

```cpp
#include "pcf8563.h"
#include "time.h"

PCF8563_Class rtc;
const char *time_zone = "NZST-12NZDT,M9.5.0,M4.1.0/3"; // [List of timezones](https://github.com/nayarsystems/posix_tz_db/blob/master/zones.csv)

Wire.begin();
rtc.begin(Wire);
setenv("TZ", time_zone, 1);
tzset();
rtc.syncToSystem();
```

```cpp
struct tm timeinfo;
getLocalTime(&timeinfo);
Serial.print(&timeinfo, "%d/%m/%y %H:%M:%S");
```

## Schematic

![Schematic](/images/schematic.png)

- Uses a CR1220 coincell (though almost any 3V lithium coincell should work)
- To prevent battery discharge, disable output clock and alarms
- Low backup current: typically 0.25uA at 3.0V (theoretical, not tested)
- Currently testing with 4.7kohm pull-ups on SDA and SCL
- Currently using a Seiko Epson Q13FC1350000400 crystal (+-20ppm)
- In theory, this setup will drift by a maximum of ~11 minutes per year ([Real-Time Clock Calculator](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/interactive-design-tools/real-time-clock-calculator.html))
- In theory, a 37mAh CR1220 battery will last ~14 years without any charging (including battery self-discharge)
- Charging a coincell from 3.3V through a diode and resistor is a topic of debate. It is important to exercise caution and consider individual circumstances. Using a 200-ohm resistor should limit the current to a maximum of 12mA, while a 1k-ohm resistor should limit it to a maximum of 2.6mA.
- Be careful with PCB placement; ensure the crystal is placed as close to the RTC chip as possible and surrounded by ground planes connected with vias
